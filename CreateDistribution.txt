How to create a distribution of RIOS. 

1. Ensure that you have fetched and committed everything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the rios/__init__.py. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
3. Update the release notes page at doc/source/releasenotes.rst, by going through the 
   change logs since the last release, and noting what has been done. 
   DON'T FORGET TO COMMIT THIS, BEFORE THE NEXT STEP!!!!
4. Use "hg tag" to add a version number tag, e.g.
    hg tag rios-1.1.1
5. Push the changes to bitbucket with "hg push".
6. Check out a clean copy of the repository into /tmp or
   somewhere similar and 'cd' into it.
7. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist --formats=gztar,zip
   This creates both a tar.gz and a zip, under a subdirectory called dist
8. Upload these to bitbucket, under the downloads tab. 


Version Numbers.
The RIOS version number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
