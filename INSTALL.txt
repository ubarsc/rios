Simple installation instructions for RIOS.

Requirements.
-------------
    Numpy.
    GDAL. This must include its python bindings.

RIOS Installation steps, for Linux and similar.
-----------------------------------------------
    1. tar xfz rios-m.n.tar.gz
    2. cd rios-m.n
    3. Install configuration is provided within the setup.py script.
       The best way to run this is now to use pip to execute it.
       To install within the default location (perhaps within a virtual
       env or similar), use
           pip install .
       To install in a different location, use the --prefix option on
       the pip command
    4. Add to your environment as follows
            Add <prefix>/bin to $PATH
            Add <prefix>/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages to $PYTHONPATH
       where pythonA.B refers to the version of python you are running.

    5. Test the installation by executing the command
            cd someTempDirectory
            testrios.py
       This will report any test failures.

Environment Variables
---------------------
    All of these environment variables can be left un-set, as they all have sensible
    default values in the code. These are used to over-ride these defaults globally. 
    All values can also be over-ridden on a per-application basis, using the 
    applier controls object.

    Full details are provied at the RIOS home page
        https://www.rioshome.org/
    
    If you wish to use a default GDAL driver other than HFA, then set
    the environment variables, which are then given to GDAL
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVER="short name of GDAL driver"
         RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_<driver>="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    Variables of the form RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_* can be used to set default creation
    options for any number of drivers.
    
    The deprecated form below will be applied only to the default driver. 
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVEROPTIONS="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    
    To change the default behaviour when determining the footprint across multiple 
    input images
         RIOS_DFLT_FOOTPRINT=integer. default footprint setting, corresponding
                to values defined in imageio.py: INTERSECTION, UNION, BOUNDS_FROM_REFERENCE
    
    To change the default behaviour of RIOS's block-by-block processing. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKXSIZE=integer. Default value for X block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKYSIZE=integer. Default value for Y block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_OVERLAP=integer. Default value for the margin around each block.
