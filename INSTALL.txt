Simple installation instructions for RIOS.

Requirements.
-------------
    Numpy.
    GDAL. This must include its python bindings.
    cloudpickle. Optional. Only required for using concurrency across
        multiple machines.

RIOS Installation steps, for Linux and similar.
-----------------------------------------------
    1. tar xfz rios-n.n.n.tar.gz
    2. cd rios-n.n.n
    3. Install configuration is provided within the pyproject.toml file.
       This is executed using the pip command.
           pip install .
    4. Test the installation with the testrios command.
           cd someTempDirectory
           testrios
       This will report any test failures.

Environment Variables
---------------------
    All of these environment variables can be left un-set, as they all have
    sensible default values in the code. These are used to over-ride these
    defaults globally. All values can also be over-ridden on a per-application
    basis, using the applier controls object.

    Full details are provied at the RIOS home page

    If you wish to use a default GDAL driver other than HFA, then set
    the environment variables, which are then given to GDAL
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVER="short name of GDAL driver"
         RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_<driver>="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    Variables of the form RIOS_DFLT_CREOPT_* can be used to set default
    creation options for any number of drivers.
    
    The deprecated form below will be applied only to the default driver. 
         RIOS_DFLT_DRIVEROPTIONS="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    
    To change the default behaviour when determining the footprint across
    multiple input images
         RIOS_DFLT_FOOTPRINT=integer. Default footprint setting, corresponding
                to values defined in imageio.py: INTERSECTION, UNION, BOUNDS_FROM_REFERENCE
    
    To change the default behaviour of RIOS's block-by-block processing. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKXSIZE=integer. Default value for X block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_BLOCKYSIZE=integer. Default value for Y block size, in pixels. 
         RIOS_DFLT_OVERLAP=integer. Default value for the margin around each block.
