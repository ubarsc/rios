Raster I/O Simplification. A set of python modules which makes it easy to write raster 
processing code in Python. Built on top of GDAL, it handles the details of opening and 
closing files, checking alignment of projection and raster grid, stepping through the 
raster in small blocks, etc., allowing the programmer to concentrate on the processing 
involved. RIOS was written for our own use, and comes without any warranty, or assurance 
that it might even be useful, but if anyone else is silly enough to want it, they are 
welcome to it. It is licensed under GPL 3, as given in the file LICENSE.txt.
