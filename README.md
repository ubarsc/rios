# RIOS - Raster I/O Simplification
A set of Python modules which makes it easy to write raster processing 
code in Python. It is built on top of [GDAL](https://www.gdal.org).

## Features
- Handles the details of opening and closing files.
- Checks alignment of projection and raster grid.
- Steps through the raster in small blocks to reduce memory requirements.
- *and more...*

This allows the programmer to concentrate on the processing involved.

RIOS was written for our own use, and comes without any warranty or assurance 
that it might even be useful. But if anyone else is silly enough to want it, 
they are welcome to use it.
