How to create a distribution of RIOS. 

1. Ensure that you have committed averything which needs to go in.
2. Change the version number in the setup.py, and commit this. Version number
   is of the form a.b.c, as discussed below. 
3. Use "hg tag" to add a version nubmber tag, e.g.
    hg tag rios-1.1.1
4. Create the distribution tarball, using
    python setup.py sdist. 
   This creates it under a subdirectory called dist
5. Upload this to bitbucket, under the downloads tab
6. Update the release notes page on bitbucket, by going through the 
   change logs since the last release, and noting what has been done. 


Version Numbers.
The RIOS version number is structured as A.B.C. 
- The A number should change for major alterations, most particularly those 
  which break backward compatability, or which involve major restructuring of 
  code or data structures. 
- The B number should change for introduction of significant new features
- The C number should change for bug fixes or very minor changes.
