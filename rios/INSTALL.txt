    2. tar xfz rios-m.n.tar.gz
    3. cd rios-m.n
    4. python setup.py install --prefix=riosRoot
    5. Add to your environment as follows
            Add riosRoot/bin to $PATH
            Add riosRoot/lib/pythonA.B/site-packages to $PYTHONPATH
       where pythonA.B refers to the version of python you are running. 

       If you wish to use a default GDAL driver other than HFA, then set
       the environment variables, which are then given to GDAL
            RIOS_DFLT_DRIVER="short name of GDAL driver"
            RIOS_DFLT_DRIVEROPTIONS="list of driver options (space-separated)"
    6. Test the installation by executing the command 
           testrios.py
